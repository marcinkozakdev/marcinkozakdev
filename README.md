### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Marcin.

I am self-taught programmer. I am currently working as a mechanical engineer in the automotive industry and I do content on design and development.
I would like to get my first programming experience. When I discovered what software is, I develop my skills in this field with passion. I really enjoy lerning languages and farameworks like C#.
